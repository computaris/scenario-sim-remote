   * General description and idea
      * OC scenario simulator with remote Robot libraries exposes API via HTTP/XMLRPC, default host/port is localhost/8270. If a different port is needed, it can be set by "com.computaris.robotremote.port" property (e.g. from scenario simulator starting script) 
      * All scenario simulator commands are exposed as robot keywords nearly 1:1
